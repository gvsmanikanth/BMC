			<h1>About the Pattern Library</h1>
	
			<p><strong>The BMC Pattern Library helps UX designers focus on delivering great experiences to our users—without reinventing the wheel every time.</strong></p>
			
			<p>As BMC and our digital presence grow, it&rsquo;s important for us to have scalable, reusable solutions for our digital designs. That&rsquo;s where this pattern library comes in. </p>
			
			<p>This reference collection represents the key components for design, UX and content that we&rsquo;ve identified for use in our current digital experiences—and to guide us when we embark on future projects. </p>
			
			<p>The pattern library lets us reuse our code and typical UX components, so that we don&rsquo;t have to waste time re-creating things we already know, use and love. Gathering them into one easy-to-access place lets designers easily find and try solutions that we know enhance our brand, as well as work well and have purpose. It speeds up our project work and serves as an internal beacon of design knowledge.</p>
			
			<p>The library is also organic. You may find components that are best combined with others, or adapted, or given a facelift, thus creating a new element—which in turn can be housed right here in the library. Think of this as a living, breathing resource that you can browse, borrow from and contribute to as needed.</p>
			
			<p>Best of all, the pattern library helps us stay focused on what we do best: <br />
			<strong>Creating the best experiences and solutions for our users.</strong> </p>
